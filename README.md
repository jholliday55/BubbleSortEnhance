Short circuiting bubble sort for faster run time. 


The point of this project is to ask users to enter eleemnts and for the program to use a Bubble Sort to sort. 

However, bubble sorts can having long run time, so I short circuited and created a better version which always runs faster.

You can just pull the; BubbleSortEnhanc. java file from the source folder. 

Thanks
